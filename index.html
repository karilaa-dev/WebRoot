            <p>
                I'm a third-year student in the Bachelor's program in Software
                Development at Bellevue College. <br />
                I really enjoy computer-related topics, especially programming
                and self-hosting. It's interesting and often really useful.
                <br />I usually do backend programming because I enjoy the
                logical and systems aspects of programming more than creating an
                attractive interface.
